# Mastermind

Mastermind is a programming language designed to compile to the esoteric language _Brainfuck_.

Brainfuck is essentially a modern interpretation of the classical Turing machine. It consists of a tape of 8-bit values, with simple increment/decrement, move left/right, and control flow operations. The full language only uses 8 control characters: `+-><.,[]`.

Imagine if C was designed for computer architectures that run Brainfuck directly, that is what Mastermind is intended to be.
