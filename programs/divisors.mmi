// the purpose of this program is to print the divisors of the numbers 1 to 100
// from https://code.golf:
// A number is a divisor of another number if it can divide into it with no remainder.
// Print the positive divisors of each number from 1 to 100 inclusive, on their own line, with each divisor separated by a space.
