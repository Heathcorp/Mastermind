Mastermind is a programming language designed to compile to the well-known esoteric language "Brainfuck".

Brainfuck is essentially a modern interpretation of the classical Turing machine. It consists of a tape of 8-bit values, with simple increment/decrement, move left/right, input/output, and looping operations. The full language only uses 8 control characters: `+-><.,[]`.

Imagine if C was designed for computer architectures that run Brainfuck, that is what Mastermind is intended to be.
