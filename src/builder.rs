// turns low-level bf instructions into plain bf
// take in a timeline of cell allocations and move-to-cell operations, etc
// output plain bf according to that spec

// this algorithm is responsible for actually allocating physical tape cells as opposed to the parser
// can introduce optimisations here with some kind of allocation timeline sorting algorithm (hard leetcode style problem)
