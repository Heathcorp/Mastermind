// Here's the brief:
// your task is to take in a list of clauses, and output an optimised version
// the main functionality will be finding when variables are actually used and minimising their lifetime to reduce allocation time

// the secondary but also very important task is to use the above variable lifetimes to use compiler construction variants that do not unnecessarily copy variables around
// maybe this second point should be in the compiler, not here
